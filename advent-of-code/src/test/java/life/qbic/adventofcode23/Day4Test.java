/**
 * In the above example, card 1 has five winning numbers (41, 48, 83, 86, and 17) and eight numbers
 * you have (83, 86, 6, 31, 17, 9, 48, and 53). Of the numbers you have, four of them (48, 83, 17,
 * and 86) are winning numbers! That means card 1 is worth 8 points (1 for the first match, then
 * doubled three times for each of the three matches after the first).
 * <p>
 * Card 2 has two winning numbers (32 and 61), so it is worth 2 points. Card 3 has two winning
 * numbers (1 and 21), so it is worth 2 points. Card 4 has one winning number (84), so it is worth 1
 * point. Card 5 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points. Card 6 has no winning numbers, so
 * it is worth no points.
 * <p>
 * So, in this example, the Elf's pile of scratchcards is worth 13 points.
 * <p>
 * Take a seat in the large pile of colorful cards. How many points are they worth in total?
